## Functional enrichment

This card displays a table of statistically significant terms, calculated instantly when multiple features (genes or proteins) are selected from the volcano or MA plot. The terms are presented in order of their odds ratio (OR). Each entry in the table provides the term ID, a description, the number of selected features annotated with this term, the odds ratio, and a list of the feature names included.

### Settings

Adjust your preferences by clicking the gear icon:

 - Select the ontology to be displayed (GO, Reactome, KEGG)
 - Set the threshold for false discovery rate to define significant terms


### Interaction

 - Sort data within the table by clicking the small triangles at the top of each column.
 - Click on any row to select it; this will activate related elements of the application. The feature information table and both plots will then highlight the features associated with the selected term.
