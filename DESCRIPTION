Description: This R package, designed for interactive exploration and analysis
    of differential expression or abundance data, integrates Shiny-based
    visualization tools with rapid functional enrichment analysis. Users
    can dynamically select genes from volcano or MA plots and instantly access
    enriched GO, KEGG, and Reactome pathway analyses, facilitating a deeper
    understanding of gene functions and biological pathways. The package
    supports customized plotting, feature information retrieval, and handles
    large datasets efficiently, making it an ideal tool for genomic
    researchers and bioinformaticians seeking to uncover the biological
    significance behind differential expression patterns.
